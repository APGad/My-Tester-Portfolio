## About Me
Hi! My name is Adrian Gadomski. I'm still a rookie in the software testing world, however I'm ambitious and looking to learn from experienced experts. I graduated from UWM and my major was English with speciality in translation. Currently I'm an intern at Test Army S.A, but I'm looking to start a full-time position as a junior software tester. I can perform manual testing, as well as automated REST API testing with Postman and JavaScript. In the future I want learn test automation in Cypress and Selenium WD.
